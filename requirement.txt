- Choose file button  ✅
- selection modal/popup opens ✅
- if i select extension other than images, then it should give me error of file format is not accepted  and then the choose file option will be cleared ✅
- if i select image extension file image and if it is bigger then 5mb then  it should show error of large file and it shouldnt show the preview ✅

issue in above section? 
-> when i upload any image with more than 5mb image then it shows error but when i upload any image with less than 5mb after that errors
then it doesnt show the preview of that image and that error stays there only

solved by -> setting state to false when the image is in perfect form ✅


- Upload button scenario ✅
- at first the upload button should be disabled ✅
- if both the condition above are fulfilled then the button should be enabled ✅



- API endpoint scenario 
-  using axios
- if all the conditions are met then it should give message of image uploaded sucessfully
- if conditions are not met then handle errors for the same 



- Multiple image file upload scenario
- select Multiple files but not more than 5 files and it should have both validation of file extension and file size 
- if selected images are not less then 5 mb then it should show the error -> "image_name is bigger than 5mb" 
- if selected file is not in image format then it should show error -> "file_name is not an image" 
- give a panel with images selected with cancel/cross button above all the selected images so that user can remove the selected file and add more
